 * ALGORITHM:--

 * First, we copied each of our weights to a cost or distance matrix.
 * Then, we ran through each vertex and figured out the cost or distance of visiting
 * from vertex i to vertex j through vertex k. If the distance or cost
 * is less than a direct path between vertex i and vertex j,
 * we choose the path i to k to j instead of the direct path of i to j
